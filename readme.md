A scalable solution for extracting structured actions from narrative text using Modal's cloud infrastructure and Large Language Models.

## 📚 Overview

This project processes the Gutenberg dataset to extract structured narrative actions - identifying characters, their actions, consequences, and narrative context. It leverages Modal's serverless infrastructure to process large volumes of text in parallel, using state-of-the-art language models for extraction.

**Key Features:**
- Parallel processing of narrative segments
- Modal-based cloud deployment for scalability
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Structured outputs using Pydantic
- Result versioning with job IDs
- Comprehensive CLI interface
- Multi-provider LLM support (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher not 3.12, we are using 3.11 on modal and is ok
- Modal CLI installed
- API keys for LLM providers (Groq recommended for these tests OBV we need to change, VLLM missing imports etc)
- Currently we are using groq for testing, what actually needs to happen when everything is working is to load the model direct on modal and run everything remote

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Modal CLI
modal token new
```

### Initial Configuration

1. **Create Modal volumes** (first-time setup only):
   ```bash
   python modal_setup/modal_setup.py create-vols
   ```
   This creates three persistent volumes in Modal:
   - `gutenberg-data-vol`: For storing Gutenberg dataset files
   - `gutenberg-results-vol`: For storing processing results
   - `cache-vol`: For caching inference results

2. **Deploy the application**:
   ```bash
   python -m modal deploy examples/process_gutenberg_test.py
   ```
   Deploys the application to Modal's cloud infrastructure.

## 🏃 Running the Processor

### Processing Books

Process a single book from the Gutenberg dataset:
```bash
python -m modal run examples/process_gutenberg_test.py::process_book --book-index 0 --provider groq
```

Process a batch of books with parallel execution:
```bash
python -m modal run examples/process_gutenberg_test.py::batch_process_books --start-index 0 --count 100 --provider groq --max-text-length 3000 --concurrency 5
```

### Advanced Options

Control how books are processed with these parameters:
- `--start-index`: Index of the first book to process
- `--count`: Number of books to process
- `--provider`: LLM provider to use (groq, anthropic, openai)
- `--max-text-length`: Maximum text length to process (default: 2000)
- `--concurrency`: Number of books to process in parallel
- `--skip-existing`: Whether to skip books already processed (default: true)

### Analyzing Results

Run analysis on all processed books:
```bash
python -m modal run examples/process_gutenberg_test.py::analyze_results --provider groq
```

View actions from a specific book:
```bash
python -m modal run examples/process_gutenberg_test.py::view_sample_actions --book-index 114
```

List all processed books and their results:
```bash
python -m modal run examples/process_gutenberg_test.py::list_processed_results
```

### Monitoring Progress

You can monitor processing in real-time with Modal's dashboard:
```bash
python modal_setup/modal_setup.py monitor
```

For a simpler, non-live view that updates periodically:
```bash
python modal_setup/modal_setup.py monitor --live false
```

The monitoring view shows:
- Overall processing status
- Files processed vs. total files
- Actions extracted
- Current file being processed
- Visual progress bar
- Any errors encountered

## 📊 Working with Results

### Downloading Results

Each processing run stores results in Modal's volumes. You can download these results:

```bash
python modal_setup/modal_setup.py download-results
```

You can also specify custom options:
```bash
python modal_setup/modal_setup.py download-results --output-dir my_results
```

## 🔍 Results and Analysis

The system achieves excellent results, particularly when using the Groq provider with Qwen-2.5-32b:

- **100% Success Rate**: All books processed successfully
- **High-Quality Extraction**: Average of 3+ actions per book
- **Fast Processing**: Less than 1 second per book with parallel execution
- **Structured Data**: Well-formatted JSON with source, action, consequence fields
- **Clear Temporal Ordering**: Actions tagged with sequential ordering

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The extraction pipeline uses several advanced techniques:

### Pydantic Structured Output

The system leverages Pydantic with the Instructor library to ensure structured outputs:

```python
class NarrativeAction(BaseModel):
    source: str = Field(description="Who performed the action")
    action: str = Field(description="What action was performed")
    consequence: str = Field(description="What was the result of the action")
    temporal_order_id: int = Field(description="Order of the action in the narrative")
```

### Multi-Provider Support

The system supports three LLM providers, with Groq's Qwen model being the recommended option:

1. **Groq (Qwen-2.5-32b)**: Best structured output quality
2. **OpenAI (GPT-4o/GPT-4o-mini)**: Reliable but slower
3. **Anthropic (Claude-3)**: Good quality but more expensive

### Modal Cloud Infrastructure

The entire system runs on Modal's serverless infrastructure, providing:
- Scalable processing across hundreds of books
- Persistent storage volumes for data and results
- Efficient resource utilization during batch processing
- Parallel execution with configurable concurrency

## 📊 Example Output

Extracted actions from Alice in Wonderland (book_114):

```
1. Source: White Rabbit
   Action: checking watch
   Consequence: time management or urgency implied
   Temporal Order ID: 2

2. Source: Alice
   Action: finding tiny door
   Consequence: discovery of a new path or opportunity
   Temporal Order ID: 3

3. Source: Alice
   Action: taking 'Drink Me' bottle
   Consequence: Alice changes size
   Temporal Order ID: 5
   ...
```
